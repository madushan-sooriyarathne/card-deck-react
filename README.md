# Draw Card App

Simple app created using React JS to expore react life cycle methods such as **componentDidMount()**

find this project live ðŸ‘‰ [here](https://card-deck.netlify.com/)

After the moment that page loads and the first render has happened, React automatically calls the **componentDidMount()** method. in this method, we are creating a suffled card deck using a cool free api called [deckofcardsapi.com](https://deckofcardsapi.com/). as the response, this API sends back a id of the deck we shuffelded. With this id, now we can draw cards (one by one or as batches) (for more information about the API, please click [here](https://deckofcardsapi.com/))
